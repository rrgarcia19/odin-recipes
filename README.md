"Set up your README.md file and write a brief introduction describing what the current project is and what skills you will have demonstrated once you have completed it. (You can also do this as a self-reflection at the end of the project, which is a good way to review what you have learned.)"

Odin Recipes is a website that links to a few recipes.
The main index page linkes to the webpages for the recipes
